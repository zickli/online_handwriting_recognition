"""
Dataset class.

This class provides a basic interface to feed samples by using tensorflow's input pipeline (i.e., queues), hiding data
I/O latency bu using threads.

A `Dataset` object is given to `DataFeederTF` object which runs `sample_generator` method to enqueue the data queue.
The `sample_generator` method returns a generator yielding one sample at a time with shape and type specified by 
`sample_shape` and `sample_tf_type`.

The way the data is passed is not restricted. A child class can read the data from numpy array, list, dictionary, etc.
